# batch-api-integration
This project is a proof of concept for frequent use integration tasks. Suppose we have an API that handles a variety of entities. Let's say we have an organization that could have employees. The issue is that we don't want to apply those CRUD operations one by one. Instead, we want to design a single JSON schema that contains complex information about integration content. It could consist of a collection of organizations (and each organization could consist of employees), some meta information, etc. So we can call this project "a proxy API" that gets some complex JSON, transform it somehow and call a particular API to get the job done.
